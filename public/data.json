		"description": "Specializing in spin and power, the Babolat Pure Aero is one of the game's most legendary racquets. At 11.2 ounces strung, this stick is ideal for hard charging intermediate players, but it should also work very well for the advanced ball striker who is looking to go on offense. Like the player who endorses this racquet (Rafael Nadal), the Pure Aero feels fast and explosive from the baseline. The speedy response and grippy stringbed provide the recipe for hitting heavy spin-loaded balls that drop hard, and the higher trajectory response makes it easy to keep the ball deep. The mid 320 swingweight draws a nice compromise between speed and stability, and the quick handling makes this a great stick for those who like chasing down balls or ripping winners on the run. At net the Pure Aero plays great on fast exchanges, and there is enough power to finish points with a bang. Ultimately, The Pure Aero remains a very obvious choice for aggressive baseliners looking to control the action with pace and spin."

It comes around with decent speed but it also feels stable against higher levels of pace, and it's versatile enough for finishing points with a bang or dropping the ball on a dime.

Aggressive ball strikers will find effective power on full swings, along with the needed control and spin to target the lines. At net, the Blade 98 (16x19) feels fast for the weight. Block volleys come off the racquet with decent pop and there is enough touch for sharp angles and malicious droppers.

		"description": "The string of choice for Stan Wawrinka, this durable co-poly string is very, very spin friendly. The slick surface of RPM Blast allows the main strings to slide out of alignment, grab the ball and then snap back to add spin to the shot. While all co-poly monofilaments do this to some extent, our lab tests confirm that RPM Blast is exceptional in this regard. Though RPM Blast offers a slightly softer feel than traditional polyesters, it is by no means the softest co-poly available. It is an ideal choice for big hitters with heavier racquets seeking maximum control, durability, and spin. (And it seems to be working quite well for Rafa!)"

This not only enables the player to swing faster in the service of pace and spin, but it also makes it easier to close out points with ambitious shots. Although this is a firm string, our playtesters loved the feel and reported zero problems with discomfort. Big swinging intermediate and advanced players looking for control and durability should give this string a serious look."
